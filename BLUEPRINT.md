# Psychodynamic Treatment of OCD 101 — App Blueprint

A complete architectural blueprint for the Psychodynamic Treatment of OCD 101 one-unit course. This document is the single reference for what the app does, how it's wired, and the contracts between pieces. For day-to-day commands and gotchas see `replit.md`.

---

## 1. Product summary

Psychodynamic Treatment of OCD 101 is a self-paced, single-user web course — a plain-language "baby course" on the psychodynamic treatment of OCD (one unit, 8 sections — from Understanding OCD: Obsessions, Compulsions, and the Cycle through A Treatment Arc, Start to Finish, covering the symptom's meaning, the function of the ritual, conflict and ambivalence, the therapeutic relationship, where psychodynamic meets the evidence (ERP/CBT), and working through). It centers on how obsessions and compulsions can carry meaning, how rituals work as defenses that bind anxiety, and how reading the conflict beneath the symptom complements the evidence-based treatments that relieve it. Students read AI-rewritten lecture notes at three lengths, ask an AI tutor scoped to the section they're reading, drill on adaptive scenario practice, and submit **one homework per section** that is AI-graded on an **inverted partial-credit scale** and AI-detection-screened. Grading is the inverted core: the strongest, most-testable interpretation the clinical evidence supports about the hidden function or conflict beneath the symptom earns top credit; the cautious "we can't conclude anything / the mind is too complex / rituals are random" dodge earns near-zero. There is **no separate test, midterm, or final** — homework is the graded model.

The product surface is two deployable artifacts in one pnpm monorepo:

| Artifact | Slug | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@workspace/api-server` | `api-server` | Express 5 API mounted at `/api`. Owns the DB, OpenAI calls, AI detection, grading, diagnostics. |
| `@workspace/qr-course` | `qr-course` | Student-facing React + Vite app. The actual course. |

Shared contracts live in `lib/`:

- `lib/api-spec` — OpenAPI source of truth.
- `lib/api-zod` — generated Zod validators (used by the server).
- `lib/api-client-react` — generated React Query hooks (used by `qr-course`).
- `lib/db` — Drizzle schema + db client.

## 2. Domain model (Postgres + Drizzle)

Source: `lib/db/src/schema/course.ts`.

```
topics ──< lectures              (one topic, one lecture per length)
topics ──< problems              (problems tagged to a topic for analytics)
assignments ──< problems         (homework only; problems partitioned by format: mcq | hybrid | written)
assignments ──< attempts ──< answers
                                ↑ per-answer keystroke trace + AI scores + per-item partial credit
practice_sessions ──< practice_problems ──< practice_attempts
                                            ↑ adaptive difficulty session
```

Notable columns:

- `lectures.body` / `body_medium` / `body_long` — the Short / Medium / Long toggle is three pre-baked LLM rewrites of the same lecture.
- `answers.{keystrokeCount,eraseCount,bulkInsertCount,longestBulkInsertChars,rewriteSegments,durationMs}` — the **diachronic trace**. Captured client-side from the textarea and submitted with the answer.
- `answers.{aiScore,aiFlagged,diachronicScore,diachronicFlagged,detectionRationale}` — frozen detection outcome at submission time.
- `problems.{itemType,format}` — `itemType` is `mc | written | hybrid`; `format` (`mcq | hybrid | written`) partitions each assignment's problems so one homework offers three parallel format tracks.
- `problems.mcOptions` (jsonb) — for MC / hybrid: each option carries a `credit` weight in `[0,1]`. Exactly one option is the zero-credit dodge; the rest form a descending gradient (`1.0 / 0.6 / 0.3`).
- `problems.writtenRubric` (jsonb) — for written / hybrid: `{ modelAnswer, yieldAnchors[], riskAnchors[], defeatedBy[] }` drives inverted partial-credit scoring.
- `attempts.format` — the single format the student locked in; `attempts.status` (`in_progress | submitted`) enforces the single-attempt lock.
- `answers.{credit,maxPoints}` — per-item partial credit awarded by the inverted grader.
- `practice_sessions.difficulty` (1–4, double) — adapts session-by-session based on streaks / accuracy.

Push schema with `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`.

## 3. API surface (OpenAPI-first)

Source: `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`. **Never** hand-edit `lib/api-zod/src/generated/*` or `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/*` — change the spec and run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`.

Tag groups and what they own:

| Tag | Endpoints | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `course` | `GET /course/overview`, `GET /course/weeks/{n}`, `GET /course/lectures/{id}` | Read the static course tree. Lectures return Short/Medium/Long bodies. |
| `tutor` | `POST /tutor/ask` (SSE), `GET /tutor/suggestions/{lectureId}` | Streaming AI tutor scoped to a lecture section. Suggestions are pre-generated starter questions. |
| `practice` | `POST /practice/sessions`, `POST /practice/sessions/{id}/next`, `POST /practice/sessions/{id}/attempts` | Adaptive practice: server generates the next problem, scoring it adjusts session `difficulty`. |
| `assignments` | `GET /assignments`, `GET /assignments/{id}`, `GET /assignments/{id}/problems`, `POST /assignments/{id}/start`, `GET /assignments/attempts/{aid}`, `PUT /assignments/attempts/{aid}/answer`, `POST /assignments/attempts/{aid}/submit` | Homework flow. `start` records the chosen format and resumes any in-progress attempt; a second start on a submitted assignment returns **409**. `submit` triggers the inverted partial-credit grade + detection per answer. `/{id}/problems` is the admin grader-lab problem picker. |
| `analytics` | `GET /analytics/summary`, `GET /analytics/topics`, `GET /analytics/activity` | KPIs, topic mastery, recent activity. |
| `detection` | `POST /detection/scan` | Run AI + diachronic detection on an arbitrary text + trace. Used directly by the diagnostics page. |
| `diagnostics` | `GET /diagnostics/system`, `POST /diagnostics/synthetic-run`, `POST /diagnostics/quality-control`, `POST /diagnostics/expand-lectures`, `POST /diagnostics/reset` | Self-tests and seed maintenance. See §6. |

The submit endpoint's response schema (`AttemptResult`) bundles `percent / perProblem[]` where each `ProblemResult` carries `credit / maxPoints / itemType / selectedIndex / correctAnswer / explanation`, plus the detection verdict — so the UI can render the inverted partial-credit grade + detection in one round-trip.

### 4.2 Conventions

- **Validation:** every handler parses input with `safeParse` from `@workspace/api-zod` and re-`parse`s outputs before sending. Never trust the request body, never trust your own response.
- **Logging:** `req.log.info(...)` inside routes; singleton `logger` everywhere else. **Never** `console.log` in server code.
- **OpenAI:** all model calls go through `lib/ai.ts` (`chatText`, `chatJson`, `chatStream`, `FAST_MODEL`). The Replit AI proxy means no API key is needed in dev or prod.
- **Errors:** thrown errors bubble to a global error handler that logs and returns `{ error: string }` with the right status. Detection failures are **non-fatal** — they return `null` and the caller falls back.

---

## 5. AI detection — `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/detection.ts`

Detection is the project's signature feature. It runs **two independent functions** and bundles their outputs into one `DetectionOutcome`.

### 5.1 Detection Function 1 — Static AI detection (GPTZero, with fallback)

Question answered: *"Was this text written by an LLM?"*

Pipeline:

1. **`gptzeroAiScore(text)`** — calls `POST https://api.gptzero.me/v2/predict/text` with `x-api-key: $GPTZERO_API_KEY`. Reads `documents[0].class_probabilities.ai` (plus half-weight of `mixed`), falls back to `completely_generated_prob`. Returns `null` on missing key, network failure, malformed response, or text shorter than 40 chars.
2. **`heuristicAiScore(text)`** — local zero-dependency scorer. Penalises long average sentence length plus presence of LLM tells (`delve`, `tapestry`, `leverag(e|ing)`, `in conclusion`, `it is important to note`, `plays a crucial/vital/pivotal role`, etc.). Used as anchor + fallback.
3. **`llmAiScore(text)`** — secondary fallback. Asks the OpenAI proxy in JSON-only mode for `{"probability": 0..1}`. Used only when GPTZero is unavailable.

Blend (`detect()`):

```
if GPTZero responded:           aiScore = 0.85 * gptzero + 0.15 * heuristic
elif LLM scorer responded:      aiScore = 0.60 * llm     + 0.40 * heuristic
else:                           aiScore = heuristic
```

`aiFlagged = aiScore >= 0.55`.

### 5.2 Detection Function 2 — Diachronic detection (keystroke pattern)

Question answered: *"Did the student paste AI output and reword it to sound human?"*

This is the novel part: even if the final text passes GPTZero (because the student edited the wording), the **act of producing it** looks nothing like organic typing.

`diachronicScore(text, trace)` reads a `TraceInput` captured by the client:

```
{ keystrokeCount, eraseCount, bulkInsertCount?, longestBulkInsertChars?,
  rewriteSegments?, durationMs }
```

It adds penalty points for:

| Signal | Penalty | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `longestBulkInsertChars > 40` *or* `longestBulkInsertChars / textLen > 0.4` | +0.50 | One paste covers most of the answer. |
| `bulkInsertCount >= 2 && longestBulkInsert > 25` | +0.15 | Multiple paste events. |
| `keystrokeCount / textLen < 0.6` with `textLen > 30` | +0.30 | Far fewer keys pressed than characters of output — paste-like. |
| `charsPerSecond > 12` with `textLen > 30` | +0.20 | Sustained typing speed no human freshman maintains. |
| `longestBulkInsert > 30 && rewriteSegments >= 2` | +0.15 | Big paste followed by reword passes — the giveaway pattern. |

Clamped to `[0, 1]`. `diachronicFlagged = diachronicScore >= 0.55`.

### 5.3 Combined outcome

`detect()` returns:

```ts
{
  aiScore, aiFlagged,
  diachronicScore, diachronicFlagged,
  rationale: string  // human-readable explanation incl. GPTZero %
}
```

This outcome is persisted on `answers` at submit time and surfaces in the assignment results UI plus the diagnostics page.

## 6. Diagnostics surface

Three routes, one page. The page lives at `artifacts/qr-course/src/pages/Diagnostics.tsx` and is linked from the student app. **These are operator tools, not student-facing features.**

### 6.1 `GET /api/diagnostics/system` — system self-test

Runs a strict ordered checklist and returns `{ ok, generatedAt, steps[] }`. Each step has `{ name, ok, ms, detail?, error? }`. The student page renders one row per step with pass/fail and timing.

Steps:

1. **Environment** — `DATABASE_URL` present.
2. **Database** — `SELECT 1` round-trip.
3. **Database** — course content is seeded (≥6 topics, ≥1 lecture / assignment / problem).
4. **OpenAI** — fast-model chat completion returns non-empty text.
5. **OpenAI** — JSON mode returns `{ ok: true }`.
6. **Detection** — heuristic+scoring pipeline returns numbers for a benign sentence.
7. **AI detection** — pasted-style LLM-tell text **flags** as AI.
8. **GPTZero** — if `GPTZERO_API_KEY` is set, the real API responds and gives a non-null score.

If any step fails the page shows the red row and the raw error string from the server — that's the debugging surface.

### 6.2 `POST /api/diagnostics/synthetic-run` — end-to-end synthetic student

Simulates a real student session against the live DB and reports each leg pass/fail/timing. Useful when refactoring the practice loop or grading pipeline. Stages roughly:

1. Create a practice session for a known topic.
2. Pull the first problem (`/practice/sessions/{id}/next`).
3. Submit a wrong answer, then a right one — confirm difficulty adjusts and accuracy persists.
4. Create an assignment attempt, answer each problem, submit, and verify `AttemptResult` returns full `perProblem[]` + `detection[]`.
5. Hit analytics endpoints and confirm the new attempt is reflected.

### 6.3 `POST /api/diagnostics/quality-control` — OpenAI answer-key legitimacy check

Independently re-derives the answer to a sample of course problems and verifies each seeded answer key is legitimate. Returns `{ ok, generatedAt, steps[] }` like the other diagnostics. Stages:

1. Collect every assignment problem joined to its assignment, grouped by assignment, and sample up to 12 with a guaranteed per-group quota so every assignment is covered even if its problem count is uneven.
2. For each sampled problem, run a **two-phase** check: (a) the LLM independently re-derives an answer from the prompt **alone**, blind to the seeded key, so the verdict can't just rubber-stamp the key; (b) a second LLM call judges whether the seeded key is legitimate given the prompt + the independent answer, using the grader's semantic-equivalence philosophy — accepting any correct on-topic short answer and flagging only genuinely defective keys (wrong, off-topic, self-contradictory, contradicted on substance, or ungradeable). Returns `{ legitimate, confidence, rationale }`; malformed verdicts are treated as failures, not passes.
3. A legitimate key passes its step; a flagged key fails its step with the model's rationale. A final summary step reports the legitimate/flagged tally.

### 6.4 Supporting routes (not in the diagnostics UI)

- `POST /api/diagnostics/expand-lectures` — generates `body_medium` / `body_long` for lectures that are missing them. Idempotent.
- `POST /api/diagnostics/reset` — wipes attempts / answers / practice for a clean demo. **Does not** drop course content.

## 7. Student app — `@workspace/qr-course`

React + Vite + Tailwind. Routes:

| Route | Page | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` (landing) / `/dashboard` | `Landing` / `Dashboard` | Public landing page; signed-in dashboard shows homework progress + Course Schedule + Recent Activity |
| `/weeks/:weekNumber` | `WeekView` | List of section's lectures and homework |
| `/lectures/:lectureId` | `LectureView` | Lecture body + Short/Medium/Long toggle + right-rail tutor / practice |
| `/practice/topic/:topicId` | `TopicPractice` | Adaptive single-topic scenario drill |
| `/assignments` | `Assignments` | All section homeworks (homework-only model) |
| `/assignments/:id` | `AssignmentRunner` | Pick a format (MCQ / hybrid / written), take the single attempt, then review inverted partial-credit + detection per item; locked once submitted |
| `/reasoning` | `Reasoning` | Four-phase Scientific Reasoning diagnostic instrument (3×3 menu, fresh items per attempt, longitudinal view) |
| `/analytics` | `Analytics` | KPIs, section mastery table, recent activity |
| `/admin` | `AdminMode` | Operator grader lab + admin toggles (disable detection, allow paste) |
| `/diagnostics` | `Diagnostics` | Operator self-test UI (see §6) |

All server data goes through the **generated** React Query hooks from `@workspace/api-client-react`. No fetch logic should be hand-written in components.

### 7.1 Diachronic trace capture

The answer `<textarea>` is wrapped in a hook (lives in the assignment runner / topic practice) that:

- Counts every `keydown` (excluding modifier-only) into `keystrokeCount`.
- Increments `eraseCount` on Backspace/Delete.
- On every `input` event, compares the new value to the previous: if the diff inserted ≥4 chars in one tick, that's a "bulk insert" — increment `bulkInsertCount` and update `longestBulkInsertChars`.
- Detects a "rewrite segment" when characters are erased mid-string and then replaced with new ones (not at the tail).
- Stamps `durationMs` = (submit time − first focus time).

The trace is included in the answer `PUT` body and on `POST submit`, then stored verbatim on `answers` so detection is reproducible.

---

## 8. README contract

`replit.md` is the always-loaded project README. It contains:

1. **Run & Operate** — every command needed in day-to-day work.
2. **Required env / secrets** — `DATABASE_URL`, `GPTZERO_API_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET`; OpenAI via Replit AI Integrations proxy (no key).
3. **Stack** — exact runtime versions and tools.
4. **Where things live** — pointer map: OpenAPI spec, generated hooks, DB schema, route files, detection lib, AI lib, pages.
5. **Product** — 6-bullet description of what the student actually does.
6. **Architecture decisions** — non-obvious choices: contract-first API, single composite logger, GPTZero failure is non-fatal.
7. **User preferences** — be direct, no preamble.
8. **Gotchas** — don't edit generated files; don't rename `info.title`; restart workflows, don't `pnpm dev` at root.

If you change anything in this blueprint, update `replit.md` to match — they are the long-form and short-form views of the same truth.

## 10. End-to-end request example

A student takes and submits the Section 1.1 homework in the written format. The full path:

1. Browser: `qr-course/src/pages/AssignmentRunner.tsx` picks a format and calls `useStartAssignmentAttempt()` (`POST /api/assignments/{id}/start` with `{ format }`); the server creates or resumes the single in-progress attempt (409 if already submitted).
2. Per item the student answers via `useSaveAnswer()` (`PUT /api/assignments/attempts/{aid}/answer`) with `{ problemId, answer, selectedIndex, trace }`.
3. On submit, `useSubmitAttempt()` calls `POST /api/assignments/attempts/{aid}/submit` with `{ skipDetection }`, validated against the generated Zod schema.
4. Express route (`routes/assignments.ts`):
   - Loads `attempt` + `answers` + `problems` from Drizzle.
   - For each answer the inverted grader runs: MC items take the chosen option's stored `credit` weight; written items call `gradeWrittenPart()` (yield/risk rubric, data-defeated penalty); hybrid averages both — each returns `{ credit, maxPoints, explanation }`. `detect(answer.text, trace)` runs in parallel unless `skipDetection`.
   - Writes `credit`, detection scores, and `detectionRationale` onto each answer row.
   - Updates `attempts.status = "submitted"`, computes `scorePercent` honoring configurable format weights.
5. Returns `AttemptResult` validated against the generated Zod schema.
6. Browser: `AssignmentRunner` renders per-item cards with the partial-credit %, the grader rationale, and a detection chip (`Human-written response · confidence 94%` or `AI-detected · 91%`); the page is now locked.

Every layer in that chain (spec → server zod → server logic → client hook → client zod) is generated or validated from the same `openapi.yaml`. Don't introduce a parallel path.
