# 🧭 Psychodynamic Therapy 101

**A One-Unit Baby Course on the Mind Beneath the Surface — Taught, Tutored, Drilled, and Graded by AI**

---

## 🧩 Overview

Psychodynamic Therapy 101 is a self-paced, single-user web course — a plain-language "baby course" on **the mind beneath the surface**: how out-of-awareness patterns, defenses, transference, and the therapeutic relationship shape how we struggle and how we change. No clinical background or jargon required.

The course teaches reasoning about the mind on an **inverted grading scale**. Most "critical thinking" rewards caution: the more hedged the answer, the safer it feels. Here, hedging is the failure mode. The **strongest, most-falsifiable interpretation the clinical evidence supports about the hidden dynamic earns top credit**; the cautious *"we can't really conclude anything / the psyche is too complex"* dodge earns near-zero; florid padding that binds no evidence scores low; and a lurid overreach the evidence actively defeats also earns zero. Every question rewards committing to the richest supported interpretation while naming the cheapest disconfirming observation.

The curriculum is organized into **one unit and 8 sections**: 1.1 What Psychodynamic Therapy Is; 1.2 The Unconscious, Reconsidered; 1.3 Defense Mechanisms; 1.4 Transference; 1.5 The Therapeutic Relationship; 1.6 Insight and Working Through; 1.7 Does It Work? The Evidence; and 1.8 A Session, Start to Finish.

Designed for **middle schoolers, curious adults wanting brief but meaningful exposure, instructors evaluating AI-taught coursework, and researchers studying AI academic integrity**, Psychodynamic Therapy 101 pairs a real curriculum with two layers of AI-authorship detection — surfacing not just *whether* the writing looks AI-generated, but whether the *act of producing it* did.

## 🧠 What It Does

- **One-Unit Structured Curriculum** — A complete plain-language psychodynamic therapy syllabus across 8 sections. Each section ships with a lesson and one graded homework. There is no separate test, midterm, or final — homework is the graded model.
- **Three-Depth Lessons** — Every lesson is available at **Short / Medium / Long** length, AI-rewritten while preserving the same examples and learning objectives.
- **Section-Scoped AI Tutor** — Ask a question about the paragraph you're reading and the answer streams back token-by-token, grounded in that exact lecture section. Suggested starter questions are pre-generated per lecture.
- **One Homework Per Section, Your Format** — Each section's homework is offered in three formats and you pick exactly one: **MCQ (long)**, **Hybrid (medium — multiple choice + short written)**, or **Written (short)**. You get a **single attempt** — it locks the moment you submit.
- **Inverted Partial-Credit Grading** — MC option weights act as data (one zero-credit dodge foil, plus a descending gradient of live options); written answers are scored against a yield/risk rubric with a penalty for claims the evidence defeats; hybrid blends both parts. Every item returns a written rationale.
- **Adaptive Topic Practice** — Generated scenario problem sets that move difficulty up after a streak and down after a miss, with explanations on every answer. Per-session difficulty persists.
- **Two-Layer AI Detection on Every Submission** — Each submitted answer is screened by both a static text classifier (GPTZero) and a diachronic keystroke-pattern detector, each with a human-readable rationale.
- **Four-Phase Diagnostic Assessments** — A single Scientific Reasoning instrument runs at four phases (baseline, two mid-course checkpoints, and after the unit) using a 3×3 menu of generated items, so reasoning growth can be tracked across the course. A configurable minimum-to-pass governs pass/fail.
- **Live Analytics** — Dashboard KPIs (attempts, accuracy, streak), per-section mastery percentages, and a recent-activity feed.
- **Operator Diagnostics** — One-click self-tests (system health and synthetic-student end-to-end run) verify the entire stack — database, OpenAI integration, GPTZero, detection pipeline, and the practice/grade loop.
- **Built-In Product Demo Video** — A screencast of the live UI ships as its own deployable artifact, so the product can show itself.

## ⚙️ Technical Features

- **Inverted Partial-Credit Grading Engine** —
  - **MC / Hybrid MC part:** each option carries a stored weight in `[0,1]`. Exactly one option is a zero-credit dodge (a claim the evidence defeats, or a non-committal refusal); the rest form a descending gradient (richest/most-falsifiable = `1.0`, weaker commitment = `0.6`, timid partial = `0.3`). Credit is the chosen option's weight.
  - **Written:** scored against a `{ modelAnswer, yieldAnchors, riskAnchors, defeatedBy }` rubric — credit rises with how much evidence the answer *binds* and how falsifiable a test it commits to, and falls for asserting claims the evidence defeats or for empty elaboration.
  - **Hybrid:** averages the MC and written parts. Section percent rolls up per item, and the course aggregate honors **configurable format point values**.
- **Two-Layer AI-Authorship Detection** —
  - **Static (GPTZero):** every submitted answer is sent to GPTZero; the per-document AI probability is blended with a structural heuristic. If GPTZero is unavailable, the system falls back to an LLM scorer plus heuristic — submissions never block.
  - **Diachronic (Keystroke Pattern):** the textarea captures keystroke count, erase count, bulk-insert events, longest bulk insert, rewrite segments, and total duration, penalizing paste-then-reword behavior, low keystroke-to-output ratios, and impossibly sustained typing speeds.
- **Single-Attempt Lock** — Starting a homework records the chosen format; submitting locks the attempt. A second start on a submitted assignment is rejected (HTTP 409) and the UI shows the locked result.
- **Diagnostic Self-Tests** —
  - **System Diagnostic** (`/diagnostics/system`): ordered checks — environment, database round-trip, course-seed integrity, OpenAI chat completion, OpenAI JSON mode, detection pipeline, AI-positive control sample, and GPTZero connectivity.
  - **Synthetic-Student Diagnostic** (`/diagnostics/synthetic-run`): spins up a fake student, runs a practice session, takes and submits a full homework attempt, and verifies grading + detection + analytics all reflect the run.
- **Contract-First API** — A single OpenAPI document is the source of truth; React Query hooks for the UI and Zod validators for the server are generated from it, so request and response shapes can't drift.
- **Streaming AI Tutor** — Token-by-token Server-Sent-Event streaming with a section-scoped system prompt so responses stay grounded in the lecture being read.
- **Adaptive Practice Engine** — Per-session difficulty (1–4 continuous) adjusts after each attempt; the next-problem generator takes current difficulty and section as input.
- **Real-React Demo Video** — The product walkthrough is a real React app exported as MP4 from a single browser tab.
- **Living README** — This README plus a companion `BLUEPRINT.md` architecture document are kept in lock-step with the code.

## 💡 Core Idea

Psychodynamic Therapy 101 makes "learning how the mind works beneath the surface" an act of *committed reasoning*.

It doesn't reward the student for finding reasons to doubt — it rewards them for **committing to the strongest interpretation the clinical evidence supports about the hidden dynamic and naming the cheapest observation that could prove them wrong.** The course teaches that, tutors it, drills it, grades it on an inverted partial-credit scale, screens submissions for misuse, and proves the whole pipeline still works with a single click.

**Psychodynamic Therapy 101 — where the strongest honest interpretation of what's happening beneath the surface, not the safest hedge, earns the grade.**

## 👤 User preferences

- The user prefers to **convert the existing app in place** (e.g. replacing the prior course content/branding with the new subject) rather than create a standalone clone — keep all functionality and format intact when making content/branding changes.
