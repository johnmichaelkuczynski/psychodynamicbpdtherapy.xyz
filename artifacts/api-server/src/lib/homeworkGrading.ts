// Inverted partial-credit grading for Cognitive Science 101 homework.
//
// This course rewards committing to the richest, most-falsifiable model the
// data supports. Grading is therefore INVERTED relative to a normal test:
//   - MC items: credit is read straight from the item's stored per-option
//     weights (data, never hardcoded here). The zero-credit option is the
//     "dodge" (a fallacy or a non-committal refusal).
//   - Written items: an LLM rubric scores two summed axes — YIELD (how much of
//     the supplied data the proposed model binds) and RISK (whether it commits
//     to a checkable, falsifiable prediction/test) — minus a penalty for claims
//     the data actively defeats. Cautious "can't conclude" and florid-but-empty
//     answers both land near zero.
//   - Hybrid items: the average of the MC-part credit and the written-part
//     credit.
