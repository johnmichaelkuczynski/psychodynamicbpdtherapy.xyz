// This course grades reasoning on an INVERTED scale: it rewards drawing the
// STRONGEST interpretation about the hidden dynamic beneath the clinical material
// that a body of evidence supports. Grading is therefore INVERTED relative to a normal test:
//   - The richest, most-falsifiable, most-committed model earns TOP credit.
//   - The cautious "you can't really conclude that" dodge earns NEAR-ZERO.
//   - Empty, florid elaborateness that binds no data scores LOW.
//
// Each section's homework is authored in all three formats up front; the student
// picks ONE at start. Per-option credit weights live AS DATA in `mcOptions`.
