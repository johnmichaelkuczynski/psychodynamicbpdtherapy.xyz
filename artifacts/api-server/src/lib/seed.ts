    body: `# What is data, really?

People hear the word **data** and picture spreadsheets, scientists, or giant computers. But the real idea is much smaller and much friendlier: **data is just facts you notice about the world, recorded so you can use them later.**

A score in a game is data. The temperature outside is data. How many slices of pizza are left is data. None of that needs a computer — it just needs someone paying attention.

## You already think in data

You use data constantly without calling it that:

- You check the weather and decide whether to bring a jacket.
- You notice the bus is usually late on rainy days, so you leave earlier.
- You remember that your phone dies by lunch, so you charge it at night.

Each of those is the same move: you **noticed something**, you **remembered it**, and you **used it to make a choice**. That is the whole heart of data analytics, just done in your head.

## From data to a decision

There is a simple ladder that turns raw facts into something useful:

- **Data** — a plain fact: "It rained Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
- **Information** — the fact placed in context: "It rained on 3 of the 5 school days last week."
- **Insight** — what it means for you: "Most of this week was wet, so I should keep an umbrella in my bag."

The point of the ladder is the last rung. A fact that never changes a choice is just trivia. **Data is only worth collecting when it can help you decide something.**

## Where everyday data comes from

You can gather data the same ways grown-up analysts do, only simpler:

- **Counting** — how many people brought lunch today.
- **Measuring** — how long it takes you to walk to school.
- **Asking** — a quick survey of which movie your friends want to see.
- **Watching over time** — writing down your bedtime every night for a week.

The trick is to write it down. A memory is fuzzy and changes; a written record stays put and can be checked.

## In the real world

Long before fancy tools existed, a nurse named Florence Nightingale collected data during a war in the 1850s. She simply wrote down what soldiers were dying from — and noticed that far more were dying from dirty conditions and infection than from battle wounds. That was just careful counting, written down. Her records convinced leaders to clean up the hospitals, and far fewer soldiers died. She didn't have a computer. She had the habit of noticing, recording, and acting — which is all data really is.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.2 Spotting patterns: how noticing turns into knowing",
    body: `# Spotting patterns: how noticing turns into knowing

One fact on its own rarely tells you much. The magic happens when you have a few facts and you start to see how they fit together. That fitting-together is called a **pattern** — and spotting patterns is how a pile of data turns into something you actually *know*.

## What a pattern is

A **pattern** is anything that repeats, trends, or clearly stands out. Three kinds show up again and again:

- **A trend** — things moving in one direction over time. "Every week this month, more kids signed up for the club than the week before."
- **A group difference** — one group behaving differently from another. "People who ate breakfast got higher quiz scores than people who skipped it."
- **An outlier** — one thing that doesn't fit the rest. "Everyone scored around 80 on the test, but one paper had a 12."

Once you can name these three, you start seeing them everywhere.

## Noticing, then comparing

Patterns almost always come from **comparing**. A single number ("I made 6 free throws") means little. Compared to something, it comes alive:

- Compared to *yesterday* (you made 3) — you're improving.
- Compared to *your friend* (who made 12) — you have room to grow.
- Compared to *your goal* (10) — you're getting close.

So the habit to build is: don't just look at a number, ask **"compared to what?"** That question turns a fact into a pattern.

## Why outliers matter

The thing that *doesn't* fit is often the most interesting. An outlier is a clue:

- Sometimes it's a **mistake** — that 12 might be a kid who left half the test blank, not a real score.
- Sometimes it's the **real story** — a sudden spike in sick kids might be the first sign of a flu going around.

Good pattern-spotters don't ignore the odd one out; they stop and ask why it's there.

## Careful: a pattern is not always a cause

This is the trap that fools almost everyone. Two things can move together without one causing the other. Ice cream sales and sunburns both go up in summer — but ice cream doesn't cause sunburn; hot, sunny weather causes both. Seeing a pattern is the *start* of understanding, not the end. The right reaction to a pattern is curiosity: "Interesting — I wonder *why*?"

## In the real world

In 1854, a deadly outbreak of a disease called cholera hit a neighborhood in London. A doctor named John Snow marked every death on a map of the streets. Looking at the map, a pattern jumped out: the deaths were clustered tightly around one public water pump. That single pattern — deaths bunched in one spot — pointed straight at the cause: bad water from that pump. The handle was removed, and the outbreak faded. He didn't run any complicated math. He noticed, he compared, and he spotted the pattern that mattered.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.3 Asking a good question (the whole game is the question)",
    body: `# Asking a good question

Here is a secret that professional analysts know and beginners often miss: **the hardest and most important part isn't the answer — it's the question.** A clear question practically tells you what data to collect and when you're done. A fuzzy question sends you wandering forever.

## Fuzzy questions vs. sharp questions

Compare these:

- Fuzzy: *"Is our class healthy?"*
- Sharp: *"How many kids in our class eat breakfast on school days?"*

The fuzzy one sounds important but you can't actually answer it — "healthy" could mean a hundred things. The sharp one is **specific** (it names exactly what to look at) and **answerable** (you can imagine the exact number that would answer it). 

A good question usually has three qualities:

- **Specific** — it names *who* and *what* clearly.
- **Measurable** — you can picture the data that would answer it.
- **Useful** — knowing the answer would actually help someone decide something.

## The question decides the data

The reason the question comes first is that it controls everything after it. The question *"How many kids eat breakfast?"* tells you:

- **Who** to ask (kids in the class),
- **What** to record (yes/no, did you eat breakfast today),
- **When** you're finished (when you've asked everyone).

If you collect data *before* you have a question, you usually end up with a messy pile that doesn't quite answer anything. Question first, data second.

## Narrowing a big question

Big questions aren't bad — they're just starting points. The skill is **narrowing** them into something you can actually check. "Is our school spending too much on snacks?" is huge. Narrow it down:

- "How much do we spend on snacks each month?"
- "Which snack costs the most per student?"
- "Did snack spending go up or down since last year?"

Each smaller question is answerable, and together they chip away at the big one.

## Watch out for sneaky questions

Some questions secretly assume their own answer. *"Why is our cafeteria food so bad?"* has already decided the food is bad before looking at any data. A fairer version — *"What do students think of the cafeteria food?"* — lets the data speak instead of forcing it. Honest questions don't tilt the answer before you start.

## In the real world

When the company that became Netflix wanted to grow, it didn't ask a vague question like "How do we make people happy?" It asked something sharp and answerable: "When does a new viewer decide whether to keep watching a show?" By focusing on that exact, measurable question, they could collect the right data — how far into an episode people stopped — and act on it. The sharp question is what made the data useful. A vague question would have buried them in numbers that pointed nowhere.`,

    slug: "sorting-grouping-counting",
    title: "Sorting, grouping, and counting",
    weekNumber: 1,
    blurb: "The only 'math' you really need: put things in order, gather like with like, and count.",
    lectureTitle: "1.4 Sorting, grouping, and counting (the only \"math\" you need)",
    body: `# Sorting, grouping, and counting

People assume data analytics is full of scary math. The truth is that the most useful moves are ones you learned as a little kid: **putting things in order, gathering things that are alike, and counting.** Master these three and you can answer a surprising number of real questions.

## Sorting: put things in order

**Sorting** means arranging your data from highest to lowest, oldest to newest, A to Z — whatever order fits the question. Sorting instantly answers "what's the most?" and "what's the least?"

If you sort the kids in your class by how far they live from school, the top and bottom of that sorted list immediately tell you who's farthest and closest — no calculation needed. Sorting also makes patterns easier to see, because similar values end up next to each other.

## Grouping: gather like with like

**Grouping** means putting things that belong together into the same bucket. You sort a bag of candy into "red," "green," and "yellow" piles. You split a survey into "kids who walk" and "kids who ride the bus."

Grouping is powerful because it lets you compare. Once your data is in groups, you can ask, "Which group is biggest?" or "Does this group behave differently from that one?" — the exact pattern-spotting from section 1.2.

## Counting and simple summaries

Once things are grouped, you **count** them. How many reds? How many bus-riders? That count is often the whole answer.

A few simple summaries go a little further, and none of them need real math:

- **Total** — add everything up. (How many snacks did the whole class eat?)
- **Most common** — the value that shows up the most. (What's the most popular pizza topping?)
- **Typical (the average)** — roughly the "middle" value, what you'd expect from a normal one. If three friends read 2, 4, and 6 books, the typical number is 4 — right in the middle.

That's it. Sort, group, count, and summarize. Almost every chart and report you'll ever see is built from these few moves stacked together.

## Why this is enough

A grown-up analyst with a powerful computer doing "sales by region" is doing exactly this: grouping sales by region, then counting (totaling) each group, then sorting to see which region is on top. The computer just does it faster and with more rows. The *idea* is the candy piles.

## In the real world

Every election night, the entire country watches sorting, grouping, and counting in action. Votes are **grouped** by candidate, **counted** within each group, and the totals are **sorted** to see who's ahead. There's no advanced math involved in deciding who won — just careful counting of groups. The reason it feels so dramatic is that everyone understands exactly what's being measured. That clarity is the gift of keeping the "math" simple.`,

    blurb: "A good chart lets your eyes grasp in a second what a table of numbers hides.",
    lectureTitle: "1.5 Seeing the story: pictures that make data obvious",
    body: `# Seeing the story: pictures that make data obvious

You can have the perfect answer buried in a list of numbers and still have no one understand it. That's because our eyes are far better at reading *pictures* than columns of digits. Turning data into a picture — a **chart** — is how you make the story obvious in a single glance.

## Why a picture beats a list

Read these numbers: 4, 11, 6, 23, 7. To find the biggest, you have to check each one. Now imagine those as five bars of different heights — the tallest one jumps out instantly, no reading required. That's the entire point of a chart: it moves the work from your slow, careful brain to your fast, automatic eyes.

## Picking the right picture for the question

The kind of question decides the kind of chart:

- **Bar chart** — for **comparing groups**. Taller bar means more. ("Which fruit is most popular in our class?") The eye compares heights effortlessly.
- **Line chart** — for showing **change over time**. The line goes up or down as you move left to right. ("How did the temperature change over the week?")
- **Pictograph** — a friendly version of a bar chart that uses little pictures (one apple = 5 apples) instead of bars. Great for getting started.
- **Pie chart** — for showing **parts of a whole**, and only when there are just a few slices. ("What fraction of my allowance goes to snacks?")

Picking the wrong picture hides the story. A line chart only makes sense when the left-to-right order *means* something, like time — using one to compare unrelated groups just confuses people.

## What makes a chart good

A good chart is honest and clear:

- It has a **title** that says what you're looking at.
- Its parts are **labeled** so you know what each bar or slice means.
- It shows **one main idea**, not everything at once.

If someone has to study your chart for a minute to figure out what it says, the chart has failed at its one job.

## Charts can lie (even by accident)

Because pictures are so persuasive, they can also mislead. The most common trick is **stretching the scale**: if a bar chart starts its bottom line at 90 instead of 0, a tiny difference between 91 and 94 suddenly looks enormous. The numbers are technically true, but the picture exaggerates. An honest chart usually starts at zero so the *sizes* you see match the *sizes* that are real. Being able to spot a stretched chart protects you from being fooled by one.

## In the real world

In 1986, the space shuttle *Challenger* launched on an unusually cold morning and broke apart, killing all seven astronauts. Engineers had worried beforehand that cold weather might cause a critical part to fail — and the data showing the danger actually existed. But it was trapped in dense tables of numbers, and no one could see the pattern in time. Experts later showed that a single clear chart of damage versus temperature would have made the risk obvious at a glance. It's a heartbreaking reminder that *how you show data* can matter as much as the data itself.`,

    lectureTitle: "1.6 From hunch to decision: tiny analytics in real life",
    body: `# From hunch to decision: tiny analytics in real life

You now have all the pieces: data is noticed facts, patterns are how facts connect, a good question points the way, sorting and counting do the work, and a chart shows the story. This last section ties them together into a habit you can use for the rest of your life — turning a **hunch** into a **decision**.

## What a hunch is, and why it isn't enough

A **hunch** is a guess that *feels* true: "I think I sleep worse when I have soda at night." "I bet the morning bus is faster." Hunches are great — they're where most good questions come from. But a hunch is just a feeling, and feelings can be wrong. The whole point of tiny analytics is to **check the hunch against real data** before betting on it.

## The tiny loop

Every analysis, from a kid's experiment to a giant company's report, follows the same small loop:

1. **Question** — turn the hunch into a sharp, answerable question. ("Do I fall asleep faster on nights without soda?")
2. **Gather** — collect a little data. (Write down each night: had soda? how long to fall asleep?)
3. **Look** — sort, group, count, and maybe chart it. (Compare soda nights to no-soda nights.)
4. **Decide** — use what you found to make a choice. (If no-soda nights were clearly faster, skip the late soda.)

Then you often loop back with a new question. That's it — that's the engine behind all of data analytics, shrunk down to fit your life.

## Honesty is the whole point

The loop only works if you're willing to be **proven wrong**. The danger is collecting data just to confirm what you already believe — noticing only the nights that fit your hunch and ignoring the rest. Real analysis means letting the data change your mind. If you check your free-throw practice and it turns out practice *didn't* help your shooting, that's not a failure — that's the data doing its job, saving you from a false belief.

## Small loops, big stakes

The same four steps scale up to decisions that matter enormously: Should a city add a new bus route? Is a new medicine safe? Where should we build a hospital? In every case it's still question, gather, look, decide — just with more data and more care. Learning the loop on small, everyday questions is exactly how you build the judgment to trust it on big ones.

## In the real world

A hospital noticed a hunch among its nurses: patients seemed to recover faster when they could see a window. Instead of just trusting the feeling, someone ran the tiny loop — they asked the question, gathered records of which rooms patients stayed in and how quickly they healed, looked at the two groups, and found the window-room patients really did tend to go home sooner. That checked hunch changed how hospitals are designed. It started exactly where yours will: with a quiet feeling that *something might be true* — and the willingness to actually look.`,

          "Two things moving together is called a pattern, but a pattern only shows that they're linked somehow, not that one makes the other happen. Often both are being driven by a third, hidden cause. For example, ice cream sales and sunburns both go up at the same time of year, but eating ice cream doesn't cause sunburn — hot, sunny weather causes both. If you mistook the pattern for cause, you might wrongly think banning ice cream would stop sunburns. The right response to a pattern is curiosity about why it's happening, not jumping straight to 'one causes the other.'",

          "A good question is specific (it names exactly who and what), measurable (you can picture the data that would answer it), and useful (the answer would help someone decide something). The question has to come first because it controls everything after it — it tells you who to ask, what to record, and when you're finished collecting. If you gather data before having a question, you usually end up with a messy pile that doesn't quite answer anything.

          "Even with a powerful computer, the underlying moves are the simple ones. First the sales are grouped by region, putting all the sales from each region into its own bucket. Within each region, the products are grouped again and the sales are counted (totaled) to see how much of each product sold there. Then the products are sorted from most to least sold so the top one stands out. The 'best-selling product by region' is just the product at the top of each region's sorted list.

          "A common way a chart misleads is by stretching the scale — starting the bottom of a bar chart at, say, 90 instead of 0. When the baseline is cut off, a tiny real difference between 91 and 94 suddenly looks like a huge gap, because the eye reads the *sizes* of the bars as the sizes of the values. The numbers printed on it might be perfectly true, but the picture exaggerates the difference. An honest chart usually starts at zero so that the heights you see actually match the amounts they represent. Knowing this lets you spot a stretched chart and avoid being fooled by one.",

          "The four steps are: turn the hunch into a sharp question, gather a little data, look at it by sorting/grouping/counting or charting it, and decide what to do based on what you found. The loop only works if you're genuinely willing to be proven wrong, because the danger is collecting data just to confirm what you already believe and ignoring anything that doesn't fit. If you only notice the evidence that agrees with your hunch, you haven't really checked it — you've just decorated your guess. Letting the data change your mind is the whole point; it's what saves you from acting on a false belief. So honesty about the result is as important as the steps themselves.",

For example, a kid wondering which recess game is most popular can ask classmates, group the answers, count each group, and see the winner — that's a complete analysis with no math beyond counting.

For example, 'Is our school spending too much on snacks?' is too big and undefined to answer directly, since 'too much' isn't measurable. To narrow it, I'd break it into specific, answerable pieces: 'How much do we spend on snacks each month?', 'Which snack costs the most per student?', and 'Did snack spending go up or down since last year?' Each smaller question names exactly what to measure and could actually be answered with data.

One way is stretching the scale: if a bar chart starts at 90 instead of 0, a tiny real difference looks like a huge gap because the eye reads bar sizes as value sizes. A second way is choosing the wrong chart for the question — like using a line chart to compare unrelated groups, or a pie chart crammed with so many slices that no pattern is visible — which hides the real story. Both let technically true numbers tell a false story. Showing data honestly is part of responsible analytics because the whole point of a chart is to help someone understand and decide; a chart built to persuade past what the data supports corrupts that decision.

    lectureTitle: "Primer: How to reason about everyday data dilemmas",
    body: `# How to reason about everyday data dilemmas

This short primer prepares you for the **Professional Judgment** check. That activity does not ask for the "right" answer — it asks *which reasons you give weight to* when you decide. Here is the kind of thinking it rewards.

## A dilemma is a clash of reasons

A real dilemma is a situation where several honest reasons pull in different directions: a promise you made, pressure to make something look good, what's easiest for you, and the truth of what you show others. Reasoning well does not mean pretending the reasons you act against don't exist — it means being honest that they had some weight, and saying why other reasons mattered more.

## Three kinds of reasons

When you justify a decision, the *kind* of reason you lean on matters:

- **What's-easiest-for-me reasons** — what is most comfortable, safe, or rewarding for the person deciding. ("It would be awkward to say no.")
- **Just-following-the-rule reasons** — what the rules, the grown-ups, or your role say to do. ("I was told to.") Rules keep order, but a rule can itself be unfair.
- **Fairness reasons** — appeals to honesty, keeping promises, and the interests of *everyone affected*, the kind of reason you could defend to anyone. ("The people trusting this deserve the truth.")

The check's score rises when you give the most weight to fairness reasons rather than to convenience or to "because those are the rules."

## How to do this activity well

1. **Decide** what the person should do.
2. **Rate every reason** by how much it actually weighed on you — be honest, not strategic.
3. **Rank your top few.** Ranking is where you say what *most* drove the decision.
4. **Read each reason carefully.** Some are deliberately empty or fancy-sounding and reward nothing; ranking one of those high is a sign of careless answering.

There is no penalty for the choice you make. What's measured is the *quality of the reasons* you stand behind.`,

    blurb:
      "Assessment primer: analysis, inference, evaluation, deduction, and induction.",
    lectureTitle: "Primer: Core clear-thinking skills",
    body: `# Core clear-thinking skills

This short primer prepares you for the **Critical Reasoning** check — a set of multiple-choice questions that test five different thinking skills. These are the same skills you use when you decide what a set of facts really shows, so they matter directly for working with data.

## The five skills

- **Analysis** — break an argument into parts: find its **point** (the conclusion), the **reasons** given for it, and any hidden assumption it leans on. Ask: "What is this trying to convince me of, and what does it take for granted?"
- **Inference** — work out what *follows* from what you're told, and how strongly. Tell apart what *must* be true, what is *likely*, and what is only *possible*.
- **Evaluation** — judge how much the reasons actually support the point. Notice when evidence is beside the point, a source isn't trustworthy, or a step doesn't really connect.
- **Deduction** — reasoning where true starting facts *guarantee* the conclusion. If the starting facts are true, the conclusion can't be false. Watch for sneaky forms that only *look* airtight.
- **Induction** — reasoning from a few examples to a *probable* general rule or prediction. Strong induction uses many fair examples; weak induction over-generalizes from too few.

## A recurring trap: things that move together

Most wrong answers are statements that *sound* reasonable or data-driven but are **not actually backed up by what you were told**. The discipline this check rewards is the same one data work demands: keep apart what the facts **show**, what you're **assuming**, and what only *sounds* right. Two things happening together does not prove one causes the other.

## How to do this activity well

1. Find the **point** (conclusion) first, then the reasons.
2. Ask which of the five skills the question is testing (a hidden-assumption question is analysis; a "what follows" question is inference or deduction; a "how good is this reasoning" question is evaluation).
3. Pick the option that follows **only** from what you were given — not the one that merely sounds true or appealing.`,
