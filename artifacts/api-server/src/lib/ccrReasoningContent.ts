// Original content for the embedded Constructive Critical Reasoning (CCR)
// diagnostic assessment (instrument = "ccr").
//
// CCR is the discipline of drawing the STRONGEST conclusion the AVAILABLE
// EVIDENCE actually warrants. The best answer commits to the conclusion the
// given evidence supports and/or names a cheap decisive test; the failure modes
// are a reckless overreach the evidence defeats and a passive give-up. Every
// scenario must contain real discriminating evidence — when the evidence is
// genuinely insufficient, declining to guess is the HONEST answer, not a dodge,
// so we never write equal-fit/no-data scenarios that punish it.
//
// These are DIAGNOSTICS: ungraded practice, retakable, never repeating. Items
// are normal single-correct multiple-choice (NOT partial credit) plus short
// open-response. For every MCQ the genuinely-best option is written FIRST,
// followed by three plausible distractors. The "can't conclude anything"
// refusal appears as a distractor ONLY where the scenario truly has enough
// evidence to decide. Options are rotated at seed/generation time.
//
// Items are spread across the eight CCR sub-skills:
//   fecund leads, explanatory yield, evidence-supported parsimony,
//   abductive commitment, correlation->mechanism, anomaly clusters,
//   cheap decisive tests, calibrated boldness.
//
// All content is ORIGINAL and scenario-based.
