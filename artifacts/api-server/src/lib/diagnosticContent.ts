// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Original content for the embedded diagnostic reasoning assessments.
//
// Two instruments, each administered twice (a baseline before the course and a
// checkpoint after the single unit) with MUTUALLY UNIQUE items:
//   - Professional Judgment (DIT-style): a realistic data-work scenario; the
//     student rates ~12 considerations by importance and ranks the most
//     important few. A principled-judgment ("P") index is computed from how
//     postconventional considerations are ranked. Stages: P = personal
//     interest, M = maintaining norms/rules/approval, PC = postconventional/
//     principled, X = meaningless (a reliability check — ranking it high
//     signals careless responding).
//   - Critical Reasoning (CCTST-style): multiple-choice items spanning analysis,
//     inference, evaluation, deduction, and induction.
//
// All items are ORIGINAL. No real DIT or CCTST items are reproduced. For every
// MCQ the correct option is written FIRST; at seed time options are rotated so
// the correct answer lands at a varied index (see seedDiagnostics.ts).
