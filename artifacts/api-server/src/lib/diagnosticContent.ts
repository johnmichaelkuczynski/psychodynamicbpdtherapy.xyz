// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Original content for the embedded diagnostic reasoning assessments.
//
// A single subject-relevant instrument — internally keyed "ccr", shown to
// students as "Scientific Reasoning" — administered at four phases (before the
// course, one-third through, two-thirds through, and after) with freshly
// generated items per attempt. It measures whether a student draws the
// STRONGEST conclusion the AVAILABLE EVIDENCE actually warrants: the best
// answer commits to the evidence-supported model and/or names a cheap decisive
// test. The failure
// modes are reckless overreach and passive give-up. Every scenario must carry
// real discriminating evidence — when evidence is genuinely insufficient,
// declining to guess (and naming the test that would settle it) is honest, not
// a dodge, so no-data/equal-fit scenarios are never used.
//
// Every item is MCQ or short open-response. All items are ORIGINAL and
// scenario-based. For every MCQ the genuinely-best option is written FIRST; at
// seed/generation time options are rotated so the correct answer lands at a
// varied index (see seedDiagnostics.ts / reasoning.ts).
//
// Diagnostics are PRACTICE ONLY — they never affect a student's grade, can be
// retaken any number of times, and never repeat the same questions. The course
// settings define a minimum number of diagnostics a student should complete.
