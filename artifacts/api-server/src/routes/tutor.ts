    `From the lecture below, write 6 starter questions that make the student APPLY the lecture's ideas to a CONCRETE EXAMPLE. Every question must hang on a specific case and ask the student to reason about that case.\n\n` +
    `THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT RULE: every question must contain an explicit, concrete, EVERYDAY example — a specific relatable situation (e.g. "a woman calls her new friend the most amazing person she's ever met, then a week later, after one cancelled lunch, decides the friend is cruel and cuts her off", "a man texts his partner twenty times in an hour and threatens to leave the moment she doesn't reply, terrified she's already abandoned him", "a young woman feels calmer right after a small cut on her arm, the only thing that quiets a wave of unbearable feeling"). Keep examples plain-language and non-technical — no technical terms, study citations, or jargon. The question must ask the student to analyze, explain, judge, or predict something about THAT example. Reuse the lecture's own examples when it has them; otherwise invent a vivid, specific one.\n\n` +
    `ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN — never produce any of these:\n` +
    `- Questions that ask for a definition ("What is X?", "What does X mean?", "Define X").\n` +
    `- Questions that ask to distinguish or compare concepts in the abstract ("How do X and Y differ?", "What is the difference between X and Y?", "How does X relate to Y?").\n` +
    `- Questions about terminology, labels, or what something is "called".\n` +
    `- Any question that could be answered without referring to a specific case.\n\n` +
    `If a question does not name a concrete example and ask the student to reason about it, REWRITE it until it does.\n\n` +
    `GOOD vs BAD:\n` +
    `- BAD: "What's the difference between idealization and devaluation?"\n` +
    `- GOOD: "A woman calls her therapist the only person who has ever understood her, then arrives at the next session icy and contemptuous after he ended the last one two minutes early — what is the sudden flip actually doing for her, and what cheap observation would tell you whether it tracks the let-down rather than something new about him? Explain your reasoning."\n` +
    `- BAD: "What is splitting?"\n` +
    `- GOOD: "A man feels a wave of panic when his partner doesn't text back for an hour, sends a string of furious messages, then feels a flood of relief the instant she replies — what might that relief tell us about what the messaging is really for? Explain your reasoning."\n\n` +
    `Cover several different major ideas from the reading across the 6 questions. One clear sentence each (roughly 12–28 words), in the student's own voice, no compound double-questions. Use $...$ for any inline math.\n\n` +
